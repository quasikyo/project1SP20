This program provides an implementation and demonstration of the ArrayList data type in C++.
Commands for the demonstration should be put in the file `intcommands.txt` and/or `studcommands.txt`.

Commands:
`make [compile]` - Compiles all files into an executable.
`make Student.o` - Compiles the object file of the `Student` class.
`make run`       - Exectues the executable generated by `make [compile]`.
`make clean`     - Removes all compiled object files (`*.o`) and the executable generated by `make [compile]`.
                   This command may generate a harmless error each time it cannot find the file to delete.
